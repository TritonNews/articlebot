This bot notifies editors on Slack when their corresponding Trello articles/cards have been moved between lists. It is written entirely in Rust (the best programming language ever). The bot currently lives as a background task on a DigitalOcean Droplet instance, but we will be looking to adjust our hosting solution in the future.

## Interacting with _articlebot_

You can interact with articlebot through commands. Commands are given in the form **[COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS]** where [COMMAND] is the first word in your query and [ARGUMENTS] is whatever comes after it.

An example of a valid command would be **track johndoe42**. In this case, the command is **track** and the arguments are **johndoe42**.

Here is a list of valid commands:

* `hello` or `hi` displays a greeting.
* `version` displays articlebot's current version.
* `tutorial` displays an overview of articlebot's command system.
* `help` displays a list of available commands.
* `tracking` displays who you are following on Trello, as recorded in articlebot's database.
* `track [USERNAME]` tells articlebot that you wish to follow card movements for [USERNAME] on Trello.
  - [USERNAME] must be exact or articlebot will not return any notifications to you.

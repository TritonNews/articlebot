This bot notifies editors on Slack when their corresponding Trello articles/cards have been moved between lists. It is written entirely in Rust (the best programming language ever). The bot currently lives as a background task on a DigitalOcean Droplet instance, but we will be looking to adjust our hosting solution in the future.
